## Overview

- A very basic calculator built using React, JavaScript and Bootstrap
- With v1 the page is responsive for most PC/laptop screen sizes. The next step is to add responsiveness for mobile as well
- With v1 only one operation can be done at a time and there is no memory button present. The next step is to add this functionality using `localStorage()`
- With v1 only the 4 basic arithmatic operators are present.  The next step is to add parentheses and a '.' for added functionality
